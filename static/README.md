# About this handbook

Inspired by [Gitlab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/), we try hard to maximize the transparency of our business. To that end, we hope that prospective customers, candidates for employment, and potential investors alike find this handbook useful. In time, it will communicate nearly everything we're able to share with a public audience.

For example, this handbook can tell you:
1. Who we are
2. How our business works
3. How we evaluate new product development opportunities

Importantly, this handbook will **not** include information that you'll find elsewhere, such as:
1. Source code for our product
2. Technical documentation
3. Up-to-date marketing materials

We frequently edit this document. If you'd like to suggest changes, please simply let us know. You can contact ned.oleary@ssoready.com or [create a pull request](https://github.com/Ned-oleary/ssoReady-handbook). 

# About us

## About the cofounders

[Ned O'Leary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedoleary/)
I've wandered in and out of a few careers. Formerly at Gem and BCG, I also did a stint in VC and throughout college imagined a graduate degree in applied math. I first learned to code while working at a computational neuroscience lab in Boston. I used to write blogs about things like [pricing](https://cranberryblog.substack.com/p/a-simple-argument-for-investing-in) and [business metrics](https://cranberryblog.substack.com/p/lets-stop-using-nps) that were popular on Hacker News.

[Ulysse Carion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ucarion/)
I'm a software engineer that unironically loves enterprise software and integrations. Formerly of Segment and Gem, I built Segment's permissions and identity resolution system. I was Editor of [IETF RFC 8927](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8927.html).

We're based in San Francisco. 

## Our aspirations

We maintain a few simple and related aspirations for SSOReady:

1. **Build extraordinary products:** we don't like to build *good* products. We want people to *love* our products, to *demand* that their friends try our products. To get there, we need to obsess over the craftsmanship of our core products, yes, but also fuss over ancillary customer experiences like onboarding, product marketing, and support.

2. **Build a valuable business:** we operate a commercial enterprise with external investors to whom we owe returns on capital. We have to build a valuable business. In this context, our business's value depends solely on the present value of its cash flow. We maximize our value by growing the business quickly and efficiently. 


3. **Build an organization we're proud of:** we all spend a lot of time at work. Our business should treat people well and feel like a fun, engaging place to work. Anything else just isn't worth it.


## Our operating principles

Corporate *values* tend to feel hand-wavy and unhelpful. Most of the time, companies toss out a hodgepodge of obviously-good-things as *values*. Instead, we adhere to a few imperative statements, each of which implies certain trade-offs. 

1. Put clients' needs first.
    * Sometimes we have to work hard on unpleasant tasks. We succeed if and only if our customers succeed. 
    * Contract size has no bearing on how much we care. Free users matter as much as enterprise customers. 
    * Customers need to trust us. Every contract should feel like a fair deal. 

2. Maintain high standards.
    * We have to take pride in our craftsmanship and do good work irrespective of the reward.
    * We should always look for ways to improve. There's always something we can fix.
    * We can't let big picture thinking distract from the details; details matter!
    
3. Tell the truth.
    * We admit when we're wrong. Most things can get fixed. 
    * We give each other direct feedback, especially when it's uncomfortable.
    * We always welcome input from our customers. 

4. When in doubt, consult [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/)
    *  See above.

## Companies we'd like to emulate

We'll model aspects of SSOReady on a few companies, listed below. Note that we admire *aspects* of these companies -- we don't necessarily admire or endorse *everything* about these companies or their products. 

* **GitLab** -- As we noted above, this handbook itself copies GitLab's. GitLab has built a large, public company with thousands of employees on a transparent foundation. They share nearly everything with the world. We'll endeavor to replicate their transparency. 

* **PostHog** -- Of course, PostHog did many things similarly to GitLab, but they made things fun and whimsical. If we're being honest with ourselves, we can be a little serious, but we can learn some things from PostHog having fun with their marketing.

* **JetBrains** -- Sometimes people say you can't make money in developer tools. By making products people love and selling them at fair prices, JetBrains has thrived. They've maintained a consistent focus on their customers despite decades of growth affording them abundant opportunities for distraction.

* **Notion** -- Notion achieved something relatively unusual in business software, developing a product that feels fun and trendy for consumers. Now, there's only so much we can learn from those guys, but we'd like our product to feel fun and exciting for users. 

* **Rippling** -- Rippling simply ships an astonishing amount of product, even as a large company. If we ever look like a multi-product company, I'd hope that we resemble Rippling. 

* **Zapier** -- We aim to run our business very efficiently. In all likelihood, our commitment to open source means we'll need to raise more capital than Zapier, but qualitatively, we'd love to replicate Zapier's independence and self-sufficiency. 

* **Costco** -- Yes, we're including a retailer. For those not acquainted with the Costco mythology, consider Jim Sinegal's [obsession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco_hot_dog) with its food court hot dog, telling then-CEO Craig Jelinek "if you raise the [price of the] effing hot dog, I will kill you." Costco engineers everything about its operations to serve outrageously low prices to its customers, even supposedly capping its markup. Maybe most critically, Costco has proven that its radical approach to pricing does not conflict with exceptional economics, returning roughly [a 10% operating cash flow margin](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000909832/5a36d19c-5e47-4e8a-a99f-81c092420972.pdf) in the quarter ended February 2024. 

# Our product philosophy

Our company puts product above all else. Maybe controversially, we believe an outstanding product is both a necessary and sufficient condition for realizing success as a company. We can get away with lots of mistakes for a long time if customers like our product enough. If customers don't like our product much, nothing else really matters.

We do hold an expansive view of *product.* For us, *product* describes all interactions a customer might have with our company. For example, we consider our website and documentation part of our product. To the extent we develop a consultative sales and support team, their contributions to customers' success would also belong to product. This matters greatly in our market -- if we do our jobs well, our customers won't think much about us after an intensive adoption phase. 

With that in mind, we don't want anyone at our company to specialize too much. We all need to understand the technical details of our product, and we also have to understand our customers deeply. 


# Go-to-market at SSOReady

## Our funnel

At least as it's imagined internally, a typical business software funnel starts with *leads*. Demand generation and outbound sales bear responsibility for generating viable leads, specific contacts that have evidenced purchase intent. The sales organization converts leads downfunnel into qualified opportunities, of which some fraction convert into paying customers. 

At a certain scale, we'll likely need some variant of that organizational model. However, our business won't look like this for a very long time. 

Our top-of-funnel has to start higher. We'll look more like a consumer business, driving *awareness.* In the short run, we're focused simply on driving awareness with developers. We need them to know that we exist. From there, our funnel progresses to *consideration*. Once a given organization has decided to implement SAML SSO, we need its developers to evaluate us as a potential vendor. We then need the developer to try our product.

We solve awareness and consideration at least partly with solid marketing, but earning our place in production environments (we consider this *conversion*) requires an outstanding product and minimal friction. We win universally if we offer both the best and easiest option. 


## Monetization

We could certainly charge money for our SAML SSO product. Companies pay loads of money for similar products already. We choose to make our product free. And it's not because we want to compete on price; being cheaper rarely leads to anything good. 

Our product costs nothing because we want to make adoption really, really damn easy. Anything that keeps companies from implementing our solution needs to go. The MIT License means no lawyers. Free means no budget request. 

Our users -- developers -- shouldn't need to fight internally to set up our product. 

How will we make money? We'll simply offer more features and more products over time. Certain features and certain products will cost money. As a general principle, tools that help an individual developer get started will remain free; products that benefit multiple, diverse stakeholders might warrant a paid plan. 

# Open source at SSOReady

Open source just makes sense for us. We'll remain an open source company.

We knew from the start that developers would require both peace of mind and convenience. Open source simply gives developers the certainty they need without spending time on the phone with us. 

Moreover, we put our software on an MIT license. You may do whatever you'd like with it!. If you end up modifying our code a bunch, consider telling us about your modifications. Users' suggestions turn into our product roadmap. 

Other open source companies have likely rug-pulled you. To the extent it assuages any concern, please understand that our internal selfish MBA consciences consider open source a significant **competitive advantage** for our business for a few reasons:
1. Open source forces us to build better products.
2. Open source lowers our customer acquisition cost.
3. Open source eases customer concerns regarding business continuity. 
4. Open source helps us differentiate from admittedly abundant competition. 
5. Open source helps us recruit great talent.

It's also just ... more fun to build an open source company. 


# Careers at SSOReady

Our business requires some measure of technical aptitude from every member of its team. some measure *be technical* to some extent. Not every candidate needs a proven history of excellence in software engineering (although it helps), but every successful candidate must combine outstanding problem solving skills with resourcefulness and an intrinsic motivation for building things. Sufficiently talented individuals can learn nearly any skill.

We are a small company, and we hire opportunistically. Compatability will vary depending on our budget and immediate needs.

If you'd like us to consider your candidacy, please email ned.oleary+careers@ssoready.com with the following:
* 1-2 sentences describing the kind of work you'd like to do
* Anything we should know about your experience; for example:
    * A resume if you have one
    * A blog, personal website, or portfolio
    * A link to your Github
    * A link to a working application that you've built
    * Any papers or documentation that you've written
    * Anything unrelated to software that you're proud of

# Investors

Our business will continue to require infusions of outside capital for some time. We consume capital daily in the normal course of business -- in no small part because we have decided to offer our products at no charge.

Fortunately for us and our early customers, our existing investors such as Y Combinator have provided our business with significant financial resources. SSOReady therefore will not seek additional financing in the near future, instead focusing resources on product development and customer satisfaction.

Potential investors should understand our expectations. We don't consider fundraising an end unto itself and would generally prefer to spend time operating our business. For this reason, we tend to decline investment meetings unless we have already initiated a capital raise. Moreover, potential investors should understand that we prize patience, ambition, and partnership above valuation; after all, when we raise capital, we invite additional owners to share in our business.

Having noted the above, kindly direct investment inquiries to [ned.oleary@ssoready.com](mailto:ned.oleary@ssoready.com).
